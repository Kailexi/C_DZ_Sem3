Remember me, remember me
I'm on my own, remember me
I'm too far gone, I couldn't see
Remember me, remember me
All the times I cut so deep
All my life I couldn't breathe
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
I don't wanna lie, that's not me
I just wanna be more than a memory
If you dream about me when you fall asleep
I hope you, I hope you
Never find someone to hold you like I held you
All I want is peace of mind, can I tell you?
When you tell me that you love me, guess it wasn't true
But I hope you
Remember me, remember me
I'm on my own, remember me
I'm too far gone, I couldn't see
Remember me, remember me
All the times I cut so deep
All my life I couldn't breathe
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
