# C_DZ_Semester 3

Semester 3 of RUDN Programming

My C solutions

Look through them don't take them to heart, some may not be correct sometimes what can you say. üòä

# 2 Versions of every single DZ:

1. Menu options, where i tryhard to make everything into 1 exe.
2. Normal versions for people who want to CTRL + C instead of learning.




# WARNING
# DUE TO enconding troubles please download raw version of files staring from lab4
Please if u want to launch with debug and CMAKE do it at your own risk
Recomendation: if you want a specific laboratory work to transfer to your pc download both normal and menu versions
Due to CMAKE debug folders and configs within.
